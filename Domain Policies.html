                <p>Failure to renew the Domain Privacy service while your domain name registration is still valid will result in the Domain Privacy being suspended, terminated, or canceled and your Registration Information will be displayed in any public WHOIS search. Domain Privacy renewals after initial purchase will be at the standard list price, which is available by logging in to your account.</p>

A Registered Name Holder licensing use of a Registered Name according to this provision shall accept liability for any harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered Name unless the Registered Name Holder discloses the current contact information provided by the licensee and the identity of the licensee within seven (7) days to a party that provides the Registered Name Holder reasonable evidence of actionable harm.</p>

                <h2>Domain Parking</h2>
                <p>Upon registration, the domain will be automatically placed on name servers provided by the Company, and Internet users that type in the domain will be redirected to a “coming soon” page (collectively, “parking a domain” or a “parked domain”). There is no charge for parking a domain. You hereby consent to and authorize the Company’s placement of a “coming soon” page, and its associated contents, on your parked domain. You may change the name server configuration (or “un-park” the domain) after the registration is complete. If you need to register name servers using the domains that you are currently registering, the names will initially be parked with the Company until you modify the name servers after the domain registration is complete, using your account manager.</p>
          
                <p>In the event your domain registration expires, your registration is no longer valid. If you are able to renew the domain name, you may update the domain to its original settings. After expiration, but prior to renewal, the domain may be pointed to an “expired” page (collectively, “parking a domain” or a “parked domain”). There is no charge for the parked domain. By not renewing the domain, the Company may place an “expired” page, and its associated contents, on the parked domain. You may change the name server configuration (or “un-park” the domain) after the renewal is complete. If you need to register name servers using the domains that you are currently renewing, the names will initially be parked with the Company until you modify the name servers after the domain renewal is complete, using your account manager.</p>
          
                <p>The “coming soon” and/or “expired” pages may contain advertisements and other materials selected by the Company, at the Company’s sole discretion. This may include but is not limited to third-party websites, third-party product and service offerings, and/or Internet search engines. The Company reserves the right to collect and retain all revenue obtained from such advertising and other materials.</p>

                <p>In the event you utilize the Company’s DNS management services and fail to configure a wildcard DNS for your domain, the Company may insert wildcard DNS records to resolve subdomains of your domain that would not otherwise resolve. The Company may point those subdomains to a web page that may contain advertisements and other materials selected by the Company at the Company’s sole discretion.

                <p>You may be notified at the Company’s sole discretion when renewal fees are due. Should these fees go unpaid within the time specified in a notice or reminder regarding renewal, your registration will be canceled. Payment must be made by such other method as we indicate in the renewal form. If your billing information is not accurate, you are solely responsible for the failure to renew.</p>
          
                <p>You agree that if you paid for any services provided hereunder by credit card or another payment service, you hereby authorize but do NOT obligate, the Company to automatically charge your credit card or payment service account and renew the applicable service(s) on or before their renewal date using the credit card or other acceptable payment information you have provided to the Company unless you notify the Company that you do not wish to participate in the Company’s automatic renewal process. The Company must receive notification of your intent to not renew (opt-out) no later than sixteen (16) days prior to the renewal date. In the absence of such notification from you, the Company will automatically renew, for a period of one (1) year at the Company’s then-current rates. You are solely responsible for the credit card or other payment information you provide to the Company and must promptly inform the Company of any changes thereto (e.g., change of expiration date or account number). If the credit card or payment service account has expired or is otherwise invalid, you are solely responsible for a failure to renew and the Company shall not be liable for your failure.</p>

Should you choose not to renew your domain name, you agree that we may, in our sole discretion, renew and transfer the domain name to a third party on your behalf as an Expired Domain Transfer (“ED Transfer”).</p>

If you are registering a domain name that was registered with, and not yet deleted by, the Company at the time of your purchase, you acknowledge and agree that the term of your registration will be for a period of one year from the original expiration date for the domain name immediately prior to your purchase, as the registration is the result of an ED Transfer (defined above). You will not be compensated for the inability to use the domain from the time it was expired until the time you are able to use the domain in your account. NOTE: You may not transfer your domain name to another Registrar for sixty (60) days from the date of any previous transfer.</p>

Certain disputes are subject to the applicable Dispute Policy. In the event such dispute arises, you agree that you will be subject to the provisions specified in the applicable Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain registration is disputed by a third party. You further agree that in the event a domain dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold the Company harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy.</p>
          
                <p>The Dispute Policy may be modified at any time by ICANN or the applicable Registry Administrator, and your continued use of the domain registered to you after any such Dispute Policy modification shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Dispute Policy and this Registration Agreement. If you do not agree to any of such changes, you may request that your domain registration be canceled or transferred to a different domain registrar. For the adjudication of disputes concerning or arising from the use of the second-level domain (“SLD”) name, the SLD holder shall submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of the SLD holder’s domicile and (2) where the registrar is located.
